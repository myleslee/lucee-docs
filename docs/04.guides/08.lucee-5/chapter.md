#Lucee 5

Lucee 5 is the first major release after forking from the Railo project. Lucee 5 is not about dazzling new features but about improving the core language and providing a complete architectural overhaul of the engine.

This brings Lucee and CFML to a whole new level!

## New Language dialect ##
In addition to the existing "CFML" language dialect, Lucee 5 comes with a completely new dialect simply called "Lucee".

[[lucee-5-dialect-lucee]]

## Language Enhancements ##
Lucee 5 provides the following core language enhancements:

* [[lucee-5-abstract-final]] - Lucee already supports interfaces, but interfaces have not been well adopted by the community, because they are only used to do "sign a contract" when you implement them. Abstract and Final modifiers are a much more intuitive and flexible way to do the same and even more.

* [[lucee-5-access=modifiers]] - Lucee already supports access modifiers for functions, but with Lucee 4 this was limited to functions, Lucee 5 now also supports the same for variables.

* [[lucee-5-component-static]] - Lucee 5 supports static variables and functions inside components.

* [[lucee-5-lambda]] - Lucee 5 support Lambda Expression alongside closures, a shorthand notation for anonymous functions.

* [[lucee-5-functions-tags]] - New and modified functions in Lucee 5.

* [[lucee-5-tags]] - New and modified tags in Lucee 5.

* [[lucee-5-cached-within]] - We not only added the attribute `cachedWithin` to the tag `cffile` and `cfhttp`, we have also added an interface to Lucee to make your own `cachedwithin` implementation.

* [[lucee-5-unquoted-arguments]]

* [[lucee-5-java-interface]] - (TODO) - Lucee provides a interface to interact with Lucee from within Java, Lucee 5 has extended this interface with a lot of new functionality, which makes it far easier to write Extensions for Lucee.

## Architecture Enhancements ##
Lucee 5 has had a complete overhaul under the hood, we have not only redone a lot of the existing functionality, we have also extended the interfaces to the engine to make way for a lot of possible functionality in the future.

* [[lucee-5-osgi]] - Lucee 5 is completely [OSGi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSGi) based, OSGi is the defacto standard in most Java enterprise environments, to manage bundles (jar libraries) used by the environment.

* JSR 223 (TODO) - Lucee 5 fully supports the [JSR 223](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_for_the_Java_Platform) standard and this is something we are very proud of. JSR 223 will open new doors for many exciting possibilities in the future.

* [[lucee-5-class-updating]] - Previously an optional feature in Lucee 4, class updating is now an integral part of Lucee 5. Lucee 5 is able to update existing classes and this has a huge impact on memory consumption, especially in environments where a lot of CFML templates are used.

* Bytecode Handling - We have improved the generated Java Bytecode produced in general by optimizing it for Java >=7 and we have done specific improvements of the generated bytecode in multiple places.

## Extensions ##
Lucee 5 has had a complete overhaul of the existing extension framework, to make them more flexible and far easier for anyone to create an extension. See [[lucee-5-extensions]]

## Install/Upgrade instructions ##
* Fresh install (TODO)
* Updating from Lucee 4.5 (TODO)
* [[lucee-5-updating-railo]]
